# Parking-Sharing

(Discontinued. The new repository is [here](https://github.com/Zsombi55/Parking-Sharing).)

A simple web application using node js & express for managing parking space booking.

---

Registered users can view both their current bookings as well as a list of available parking spaces, and make reservations.

For the moment only the system administrator (who has access to the database) can register both new users and parking spaces.
